<p><em>Illusions!
some people describe you as illusions.
some say you remind them of magic and dreams coming true.
and perhaps a few more, cozy and beautiful.
i look up and realize,
you remind me of a love i had.
nice and subtle,
and yet, just enough to leave it's impact.
sure, it was short lived and fleeting
but that's what clouds are, aren't they?
after all, you were clouds
but baby, i was the entire sky.
my lips curl into a faint smile
unbeknownst to me,
and i continue on my way. </em>
